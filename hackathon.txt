🌐 Go Universal & Deploy (G.U.D)
What is Push Chain?
Push Chain is a shared-state Layer 1 blockchain built to eliminate fragmentation across all chains.

Push enables you to build Universal Apps that can support transactions from any chain (Ethereum, Solana, EVM L2s, L3s) - without requiring users to juggle between multiple wallets, tokens or gas mechanics.

In short, Deploy once, go cross-chain & 10X your user base.

What makes Push Chain unique?
Devs deserve better for their apps - more users, more revenue, more distribution.

Expand Your Userbase Instantly: Deploy once, reach users across EVM + non-EVM chains (yes, even Solana!).
Avoid Audit Friction: Since you do not modify your solidity code, there is no need for a full re-audit.
Simplified Fees: Automatically routes gas fees under the hood. Users do not need to hold $PC tokens or switch chains to complete transactions.
Consistent DevEx: One Push SDK, one set of JSON-RPC endpoints, and a unified API to build and deploy. Supports Viem, ethers, and our own Push Chain client.
Future-Proof Builds: With shared state and programmable solvers (coming soon), you can orchestrate complex workflows with multichain R/W operations - without building separate adapters.

🏗️ What Can You Build?
You can transform an existing EVM app into a Universal App, or build a brand-new Universal App from scratch.

What are Universal Apps?
Universal Apps are fully interoperable apps deployed on Push Chain that support transactions from any EVM, non-EVM chain (eg: Solana, Ethereum, Base, etc) - without relying on centralized relayers, bridges or other hacks.

Any EVM app can be converted into a Universal App using the Push Chain SDK

Deploy your existing EVM app	Build a new universal app
No contract rewrites - deploy & instantly reach all chains.	Start fresh and explore bold new ideas that could scale into profitable startups.
